HW6 Problem 1

Question 1: Explain how strcmp works

This function is used to compare the characters of 2 strings. It starts at the 
first character on each string and compares each character until the string
ends, or there are differing characters. In the program, this is used to check
the command line arguments.

Question 2: Explain the statement: FILE* fp; 

This statement sets up a pointer "fp", that points to the address of "FILE". In
the program, it is used to read and write to the LED control files.

Question 3: Explain how sprintf works

This function is used to format a string and store it in a buffer. In the
program, it is used to complete pathnames to files.

Question 4: Explain how fprintf works

This function is used to format a string and write it to a file. In the program
it is used to turn the LED on and off. It changes the value of the LEDs within
the LED control files.

Question 5: Explain how fgets works

This function is used to read a line from a file into a buffer. In the program
it is used to read characters into the "line" buffer. It does this until NULL is
returned (end of file).
